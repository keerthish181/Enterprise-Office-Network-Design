# Enterprise Office Network Design using Cisco Packet Tracer

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an enterprise-level office network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is segmented into multiple departments using VLANs and secured using Access Control Lists (ACLs).

## Features Implemented
- Multi-department office network (HR, Admin, Sales, IT)
- VLAN-based logical segmentation
- Inter-VLAN routing using Router-on-a-Stick
- DHCP for automatic IP address allocation
- ACL-based security enforcement
- Real-world traffic testing and verification

## Real-World Scenario
Sales department traffic is restricted from accessing HR resources, while IT retains full access for management purposes.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco IOS CLI

## How to Run
1. Download the `.pkt` file.
2. Open it in Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Use the Command Prompt on PCs to test connectivity and ACL behavior.
